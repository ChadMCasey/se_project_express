# WTWR (What to Wear): Back End

The backend of WTWR includes Node js, Express js, and Mongodb. Using these technologies allowed us to design a REST API featuring standard CRUD operations. This backend will bolt onto the front end of our site and successfully complete what is my first full stack application.

## Tools & Technology

- HTML, CSS, Javascript
- React JS
- Node JS
- Express JS
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- Responsive Web Design Principles

## A Demo Of The Site

- Upon the projects completion, there will be a video demonstration featured here.
